# Data Science Capstone Project - Word Prediction App

This project is the final Capstone Project of the John Hopkins Data Science Specialization Program, hosted by Coursera in collaboration with SwiftKey. The final result of the project is an application that simulates SwiftKey's text input app mostly seen on smartphones text messaging or web search sites where next words are predicted when a user input or type in a word. The coding and algorithms for the project are all done in R. Natural Language Processing techniques are implemented to do the text data mining and the prediction.

The project is divided into stages with the beginning part involving the preparation of the data such as cleaning, transformations and analysis of the original dataset. A Milestone Report for this Exploratory Data Analysis and data preparation is created as part of the project. You can directly access it on my RPubs by clicking [here](http://rpubs.com/adrianromano/396892).

The next stage of the project is about the creation of the application and publishing a slide deck presentation that explains the application. The Application is published on the shinyApps website and is available to use by clicking [here](https://adrianromano.shinyapps.io/word_prediction_app/).
