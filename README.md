## Data Science Capstone Project - Word Prediction App

This is the Capstone Project for the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization, hosted by Coursera in colaboration with SwiftKey. The overall goal of this project is to make a Natural Language Processing predictive application that returns a suggestion of the next word based on text that are inputted. Examples of such features are commonly found in web search sites and text messaging.

The dataset is obtained from the HC Corpora corpus and contains three textfile datasets (Blogs, News, Twitter). The files are provided in German, Russian, Finnish and English. The raw dataset is available to download [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip). We only use the English files for this project.

The project is divided into stages with the beginning part involving the preparation of the data such as cleaning, transformations and analysis of the original dataset. A Milestone Report for this Exploratory Data Analysis and data preparation is created as part of the project. You can directly access it on my RPubs by clicking [here](http://rpubs.com/adrianromano/396892). See the Milestone Report folder on this repository to see the R codes for the report.

The next stage of the project is about the creation of the application and publishing a slide deck presentation that explains the application. The Application is published on the shinyApps website and is available to use by clicking [here](https://adrianromano.shinyapps.io/word_prediction_app/). See the Application folder on this repository to see the R codes and data files for the app.

The slide deck presentation is available to access by clicking [here](http://rpubs.com/adrianromano/397611). See the Presentation folder on this repository to see the R codes and data files for the presentation.
